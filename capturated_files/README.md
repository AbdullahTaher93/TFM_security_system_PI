# Capturated files

In these subdirectories are stored by default all image and video files that have been captured by the application.

Their structure is as follows:

- **alerts:** Here are stored all photos and videos that have been generated by alerts (automatic mode).

  - **false_positive:** If the object detector agent is enabled, all the captured alerts will be stored here in which the p
 resence of no person has been detected, that is to say, that an alert has been captured without detecting any person 
 (cat, dog, air...).
 
- **photos:** All manually captured photos will be stored in this directory.
- **videos:** All manually recorded videos will be stored in this directory.
